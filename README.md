# PlottyBot Driver

DRAFT

PlottyBot Driver is the Python-based motor controller for PlottyBot, originally developed by Ben Servoz (https://ben.akrin.com/) . This driver directly interfaces with PlottyBot’s motors, enabling precise control of XY plotting movements.

## Features
- **Direct Motor Control**: Receives commands to control PlottyBot’s motors.
- **XY Plotting Support**: Supports XY-based instructions for drawing.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the driver script to start motor control for PlottyBot. (wait not so simple)

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x 
- Motor control libraries (e.g., GPIO for Raspberry Pi)
